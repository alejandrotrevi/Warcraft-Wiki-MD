```mediawiki
{{wowapi}}
Returns a random number within the specified interval.
 rand = math.random([ [low, ] high])
 rand = random([ [low, ] high])

==Arguments==
:;low:{{apitype|number}} - lower integer limit on the returned random value.
:;high:{{apitype|number}} - upper integer limit on the returned random value.

==Returns==
:;rand:{{apitype|number}} - Generated random value. If no arguments were specified, the value is a uniformly-distributed decimal between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). Otherwise, returns a uniformly-distributed integer between <code>low</code> (1 if not specified) and <code>high</code>, both bounds inclusive.

==Details==
* The random numbers generated by this function are backed by a cryptographically secure RNG source. This differs from the Lua implementation of math.random, which is instead available as {{api|fastrandom}}.

==See also==
* {{api|fastrandom}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 5.4.2|note=The <code>random</code> and <code>math.random</code> functions now use the <code>securerandom</code> RNG added in 5.4.0. The  standard library-derived random number generator is available as {{api|fastrandom}}.}}
