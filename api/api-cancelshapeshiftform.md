Cancels a shapeshift form.
 CancelShapeshiftForm()

==Details==
* Shapeshifting cannot be cancelled through normal buff functions as that would allow insecure code to manipulate the [form] macro conditional.
* You can use /cancelform in a macro instead.

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 3.0.2|note=Protected.}}
