Appends a string to the debug frame text buffer for crash reporting.
 addframetext(text)

==Arguments==
:;text:{{apitype|string}} - A string to log in the frame text buffer.

==Details==
* The frame text buffer is included as part of crash dumps generated by the client.
* The frame text buffer is not cleared every frame. Instead, the client will keep accumulating strings into the buffer across multiple frames until it reaches a fixed capacity, at which point the buffer is then cleared.

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
