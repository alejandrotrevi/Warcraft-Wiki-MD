 SummonRandomCritter()

==Details==
* This function is part of the companions API that was deprecated for battle-pets with the introduction of the Pet Journal. Calling it will result in {{api|t=e|UI_ERROR_MESSAGE}} being fired.
* Use {{api|C_PetJournal.SummonRandomPet}} instead.

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 5.0.4|note=No longer functional; fires {{api|t=e|UI_ERROR_MESSAGE}} instead of summoning a random companion.}}
* {{Patch 3.3.3|note=Added.}}
