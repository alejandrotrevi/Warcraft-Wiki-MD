The following content is in MediaWiki markdown format:

```mediawiki
{{wowapi}} __NOTOC__
Stops the currently playing music.
 StopMusic()

==Details==
This does '''not''' affect the built-in zone music, only music files that are played with [[API PlayMusic|PlayMusic]].

Before Patch 2.2, this function would fade the currently playing music out.  After Patch 2.2, it stops it immediately without a fade.
